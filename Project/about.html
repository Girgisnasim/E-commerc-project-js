                        <h2>History of Ecommerce</h2>
                        <p>
                            The history of ecommerce goes back to the early 1990s. The ecommerce phenomenon kicked off in 1991 when the
                            online
                            world
                            became more recognizable. It took some time but was open for commercial use sooner than expected. Since then,
                            many
                            businesses took up their residence over the World Wide Web.
                    
                            As soon as the common men became familiar with the internet by 1994, ecommerce become popular. Security
                            protocols
                            like
                            DSL and HTTPS nearly took around four years to effectively develop in order to allow a quick

                    During the year 2000, many businesses from the USA and Western Europe went online to sell their products and services.
                    This was the time when the meaning of “ecommerce” changed. Many retailers saw the benefits of ecommerce and began to
                    optimize their websites in order to expand their businesses online.
                    
                    By the end of 2001, Business-to-Business (B2B) model became the most effective domain of ecommerce as it made roughly
                    $700 billion in revenue. Since then, ecommerce has seen an unprecedented growth as online sales continued to rise.
                    
                    If we speak about the growth of ecommerce in the last decade, according to Google Trends, it has remained steady with
                    nominal fluctuations since 2008 until 2015/2016. However, the trend of ecommerce began to grow with a promising incline
                    since 2016/2017 and since then, more and more businesses began to create their online presence in order to grow in
                    today’s digital landscape.
